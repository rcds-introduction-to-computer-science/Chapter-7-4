// Exercise 7-4: OK, here is the opposite problem. 
// Here is a line of code that assumes a function that 
// takes two numbers, multiplies them together, and 
// prints the result to a message window. Write the 
// function definition that goes with this function call.

void setup() {
  multiply(5.2, 9.0);
